- Huge rock/metal music enthusiast
- Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Java, and SQL developer
- Currently working on too much homework and far too many projects.
- Always desperately searching for a website idea

Back in 8th grade, I developed <a href="https://lfm.ronenjain.com" target="_blank">linksfor.me</a>, an enhanced URL Shortener, and <a href="https://school.ronenjain.com" target="_blank">this fun school clock</a>, a helpful little web app to let you know when the misery of whatever class you're in will end.

Some of my other fun side projects included a [record player visualizer](https://vinyl.ronenjain.com) that connects to your Spotify account, this [not-so-friendly Discord chatbot](https://bullyme.ronenjain.com) that is in over 10k servers, and a [Wordle-inspired headline guessing game](https://aiheadlines.web.app) using ChatGPT.

I have interned with the Philadelphia Phillies' Research and Development Department, worked with [Tiny Village Spirit](https://tinyvillagespirit.org), and developed [ElderSafe](https://eldersafe.ronenjain.com) for the Congressional App Challenge.
