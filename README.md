# Hey, I'm Ronen! 👋
### High School Developer | Aspiring Social Impact Technologist | Rock/Metal Enthusiast

## 👨‍💻 About Me
- 🎸 Huge rock/metal music enthusiast  
- 🧑‍💻 Skilled in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, **Java**, **React**, and **SQL**
- 🧠 Experience in using **Git**, **Firebase**, **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Expo**, and **Vercel**.
- 📚 Currently juggling too much homework and far too many random projects
- 💡 Always on the lookout for creative website and app ideas

### 🔹 **Where It All Began (Middle School Projects)**  
These were my earliest experiments with coding, where I threw together snippets from Stack Overflow and confusing CSS to make hardly working (yet so satisfying to complete) projects.
- **[linksfor.me](https://lfm.ronenjain.com)** (8th Grade): A URL shortener + link grouping tool.
- **[whenislun.ch](https://school.ronenjain.com)** (8th Grade): A little web app that tells you when class will end.
- **[Pitcher Predictor](https://pitcher.ronenjain.com)** (8th Grade): A Flask app that predicts the starting pitchers of upcoming baseball games.

### 🔹 **High School Projects**  
As I've gained more experience, I've started working on more meaningful projects:
- **[ElderSafe](https://eldersafe.ronenjain.com)** (10th Grade): A mobile app for identifying home safety hazards for seniors.  
- **[Tiny Village Spirit](https://tinyvillagespirit.org)** (10th Grade): Built the website for a Bay Area non-profit focused on housing justice and reform.  
- **[Stealth Startup](#)** (11th Grade): A product customization engine and e-commerce platform dedicated to providing emotional support to families grieving the loss of a child.

### **Of course, I've still had some fun...** 
I wouldn't say these are my most useful projects.
- **[Record Player Visualizer](https://vinyl.ronenjain.com)** (9th Grade): A web app powered by Spotify API.
- **[BullyMe](https://bullyme.ronenjain.com)** (8th Grade): A not-so-friendly Discord chatbot that ~~is~~ was in over 10k servers
- **[Headline or Headlie](https://aiheadlines.web.app)** (9th Grade): A Wordle-inspired headline guessing game made using ChatGPT.
