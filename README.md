 -->
- Huge rock/metal music enthusiast
- Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Java, and SQL developer
- Currently working on too much homework and far too many projects.
- Always desperately searching for a website idea

I am the developer of <a href="https://linksfor.me" target="_blank">linksfor.me</a>, an enhanced URL Shortener, and of <a href="https://whenislun.ch" target="_blank">this fun school clock</a>, a helpful little web app to let you know when the misery of whatever class you're in will end.

Some of my other fun side projects include a [record player visualizer](https://vinyl.bob-brown.com) that connects to your Spotify account, this [not-so-friendly Discord chatbot](https://bullyme.xyz) that is in over 10k servers, and this [fancy React site](https://sogiai.com) I made during pride month.

I have interned with the Philadelphia Phillies' Research and Development Department, worked with [Tiny Village Spirit](https://tinyvillagespirit.org), and developed [ElderSafe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bobbrown.eldersafe) for the Congressional App Challenge.
